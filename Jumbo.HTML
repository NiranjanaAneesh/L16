                Coding
            </h1>

            <p> Coding, or computer programming, is the process of writing instructions for computers to perform tasks:
            What it is
            Coding is a way to communicate with a computer using programming languages to tell it what to do. It's similar to
            writing a recipe, but instead of telling a person how to cook, you're telling a computer how to perform a task.
            How it works
            Programmers write instructions in a programming language, such as Java or Python, which is then converted into a format
            that the computer can understand and execute.
            What it's used for
            Coding is used to create computer software, applications, websites, and other digital tools. It's also used to build
            operating systems, traffic signals, virtual assistants, and more.
            Benefits
            Coding can help you stand out from the competition in an interview process or help you negotiate a higher salary. It's
            also important for innovation and technological advancement.</p>
